A better approach in cases like this where you do not have memory problems, is to do `x1 = x.step1()`, `x2 = x1.step2()` and so on, i.e., create a new variable after each transformation or set of transformations.\n","\n","<font size=\"-1\" color=\"gray\">(Remove this cell when delivering.)</font>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QMA3CoB2htZr"},"source":["Author: <font color=\"blue\">Your name here</font>\n","\n","E-mail: <font color=\"blue\">Your e-mail here</font>\n","\n","Date: <font color=\"blue\">The current date here</font>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GprEZVsWhtZt"},"source":["# 0.
